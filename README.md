- Server-side web development: It is a development where the program runs on a server dealing with the generation of content of web pages.
- Content management systems (CMS): It is a framework already designed by other programmers and coders on which you can either contribute your knowledge and skills or just use those codersâ€™ skills to design your own website or blog
- E-commerce websites: E-commerce, or electronic commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods and services over the Internet.
- Database-driven applications: It is a software application that relies on a database to store, manage, and retrieve data. It utilizes a database management system (DBMS) to organize and manipulate data, enabling efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.
- Web APIs: It is an API as the name suggests, it can be accessed over the web using the HTTP protocol. It is a framework that helps you to create and develop HTTP-based RESTFUL services.

# Basic PHP Syntax
- A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.
- A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>:

```php
<?php
// This is a simple PHP script that echoes "Hello, World!"
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```
# PHP Case Sensitivity
In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.
```php
<?php
ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
echo "Hello World!<br>";
EcHo "Hello World!<be>";
?>
```
# Note: However; all variable names are case-sensitive!
Look at the example below; only the first statement will display the value of the $color variable! This is because $color, $COLOR, and $coLOR are treated as three different variables:

Example
$COLOR is not same as $color:
```php
<?php
$color = "red";
echo "My car is " . $color . "<br>";
echo "My house is " . $COLOR . "<br>";
echo "My boat is " . $coLOR . "<br>";
?>
```
